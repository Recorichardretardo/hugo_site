I've spent a long time thinking that the things I had to do were things I was naturally good at. In school, I exceled in math courses so when I went to college I became a math major. I wasn't passionate about math. When I was a sophomore in college, I took a software engineering course. It didn't come naturally to me, but I liked it. I love being able to solve a logical problem and see the result. It still doesn't come easy to me and I'm always learning. But I guess loving something isn't meant to be easy.
