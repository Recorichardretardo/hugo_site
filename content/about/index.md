    <p>Above you can find some useful icon links! If you want to see my most recent job positions check out my LinkedIn. I also have my Medium account that I plan to use (more often) to write tech related blog posts and my Github so you can see my current and past active projects.</p>
    <p>I love to game, travel and have recently gotten into photography. In the past few years I've traveled to, in alphabetical order: Canada, Iceland, Spain, Sweden, the UK and hopefully many more to come. Unfortunately, I don't have pictures of all the places I've traveled to but plan to take pictures and post them here of all future places and any other fun events that I attend. If you go to my photography section right now you can find pictures from 2018
    and onward.</p>
    <p>Feel free to reach out!</p>
