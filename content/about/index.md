    <p>I'm a software engineer currently living in the Austin, Texas area.</p>
    <p>Above you can find some useful icon links! If you want to see my most recent job positions check out my LinkedIn.
    I also have my Medium account that I plan to use (more often) to write tech related blog posts and my Github so you
    can see my current and past active projects.</p>
    <p>I love to game, travel and have recently gotten into photography. In the past few years I've traveled to, in
    alphabetical order: Canada, Iceland, Spain, Sweden, the UK and hopefully many more to come. Unfortunately, I don't
    have pictures of all the places I've traveled to but plan to take pictures and post them here of all future places
    and any other fun events that I attend. If you go to my photography section right now you can find pictures from 2018
    and onward. I've recently made a big move from the Detroit Metro area back to Austin so there aren't many pictures in
    the past few months but plan to change that very, very soon. Every group of pictures should have a description to
    provide a small insight into what to expect as you look through.</p>
    <p>If you have an idea on something you think I would be a good fit to work on with or would like to get in touch about taking pictures just reach out!</p>
