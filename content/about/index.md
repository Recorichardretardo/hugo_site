    <p>I've spent a long time thinking that the things I had to do were things I was naturally good at. In school, I exceled in math courses so when I went to college I became a math major. I wasn't passionate about math. When I was a sophomore in college, I took a software engineering course. It didn't come naturally to me, but I liked it. I love being able to solve a logical problem and see the result. It still doesn't come easy to me and I'm always learning. </p>
    <p>I love to game, travel and have recently gotten into photography. If you have an idea for a project or would like to get in touch about taking pictures just reach out!</p>
